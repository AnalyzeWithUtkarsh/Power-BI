# Power-BI
Power BI reports are created to get a better understanding of data by visualising it.
In this repositories there are 2 reports one on Zomato dataset and the other one IPL Auction dataset.
Here in this report I visualised the Zomato dataset that was regarding restuarants that are listed on Zomato. 
In second report IPL auction players data is used to get insights from it.
